Does she know I'm behind this?,No idea.,Good! Keep her here until the wedding to King Dominick is cancelled.,Then we'll see who the princess marries!,"Oh, he is nasty! Just like his dog. Think you could get me up to the roof?"
I do not know. It is pretty high up.,"You can do this! Trust me, Hervé. Just count to three.","Un, deux, troi-AHHHHH!!!","Thank you, Hervé. A girl's got to do what a girl's got to do!",Serafina?

Gasps) Are you out of your mind?,"Just listen. I suspect Preminger, the queen's adviser, has taken the princess off somewhere so the Royal Wedding will be cancelled.",That's awful.,"If you pretend to be the princess, just for a short while, I can trick Preminger into revealing where he's hiding her.","Pretend to be royalty? I could get thrown in prison, or worse!"
As can I but...,"She's in real trouble, isn't she? A girl like me... Count me in.",Would you look at the size of this place!,The likeness is remarkable.,Except for my hair.
I've thought of that.,Wolfie! Nice!,Blond in a box.,"Um, Julian, we're missing one teeny tiny detail. I don't know a thing about being a Princess.",Leave that to me.

To be a princess is to always use your head. Erika: Ahh!,"It is official, then. Due to the disappearance of the princess, the wedding to King Dominick is cancelled."
"Your Highness, wait! May I present, Princess Anneliese.",Darling?,Whoa! Phew.,"Anneliese? Oh-ho, you're back! Where have you been?",I am sorry. I should not have run away.

"And then, only a few short days before the wedding. Has anyone seen my spectacles?","If you'll excuse me, I must be off to see to the... ack!... arrangements. Ahh!

"Get out of that bed! I can figure out how the princess escaped you fools! But why didn't she tell the queen she'd been captured? Hmm, something's odd. I must solve this Princess puzzle if I'm to be King.",King? Preminger?,"Looking for something, Julian?",How can you be King?,You're the tutor. You're supposed to have all the answers.
"Come here, Serafina.",Who goes there?,Princess Anneliese!,"If you're the princess, I'm the king.","But, I am the princess."
Really? Then how come I just saw the princess eating dinner with the queen?,What princess?,Now move along before I lost my temper.,You are speaking to Princess Anneliese! Let me through!,I said move along! Now!
