Bangs spoon on cup, which makes the princesses quiet) Please, quiet down! The girls hear him and tell each other to quiet down. Deliah taps Courtney's shoulder which gets her attention.) Ahem, it's been pointing out to me that, um, you could be doing more to be, um, well, proper princesses.","Like what, Papa?"
"Well, like, uh, well, I'd, perhaps, uhh, um–",The royal cobbler has arrived.,He's here!,"Bye, Papa!",Bye!
"Stands up) Wait, girls! They're just shoes!",Gasps) Just shoes?! Walks out),Aren't they?,"They're dancing shoes, Papa. Kisses Randolph on cheek, then rushes out of the dining room)","Uh. Twyla goes on table again, then drinks Genevieve's soup) Bon Appetite, Twyla."
"Derek, Derek, Derek!",You have our shoes?,Can we see?,Was I supposed to bring shoes?,Yes!
"Maybe you can help me. Gives Lacey a key, which she opens the box containing shoes)",So daring! They're lovely!,"You're amazing, Derek!","I'm glad you like them, Your Highnesses. He gives each of the princesses their shoes, Fallon sighs when she gets hers)","Right, Felix."
Anything for me?,Are you kidding? He burned the midnight oil for you.,"That'll do, Felix! Derek brushes Felix out, which causes him to fly away) He's just a bird. He doesn't know what he's saying!","Oh, of course.",She and Isla run to Derek) Can you please...
...tighten our shoes?,"These are yours. Gives Genevieve's shoes to her, the twins pull him away) I hope you like them, Your Highness!","Looks at shoes, then gasps) Oh! Thank you!","Derek tightens Hadley and Isla's shoes) Thank you, Derek!","Thanks, Derek! She and Hadley run out of the scene)"
"Flies back onto Derek's shoulder) You blew your chance, Romeo!","What chance? She's a princess!

You play?,Hides flute so he won't tell the truth) I...I don't. Not really.,"Runs into scene, along with Kathleen and Lacey) Will you play for us?","Please, Derek, please?","As you wish, Your Highnesses."
"Sighs) I love them. But at times, I don't understand them. If only you were here.",Why use the closet when the floor is closer?,"Exactly! Genevieve, is it the shoes you like?",Or the cobbler who made them? The girls laugh at that),What are you talking about?
Derek is so cute!,"If you say so, Fallon.",Maybe the problem is he's not a prince.,"I don't care if he's a prince, a king or an emperor! The truth is...",...you are head over heels!
"Don't be ridiculous. Besides, he never notices me. If I were, paying attention, which I'm not.",Genevieve's got it bad! The girls laugh again),"Walks to her bug collection with Thomas in her hands) Good night, Thomas! Puts Thomas in his box) Richard. Opens Richard's box, then goes to Harold's box, which is empty.

Huh?,"Tries to walk with all of the luggage while Rowena walks up to the entrance) And the carriage, M'Lady.","Oh, we won't be needing it again.","Welcome, Duchess Rowena. The King is expecting you."

And it looks like I have my work cut out for me!,Scares Twyla from above) Boo!,Meow!,Aww! A little scaredy cat! Claws at Twyla),"Are you kidding? I come from a long line of ferocious tigers, from the deepest jungles of India! Roaaar!"
"Yeah, right. You're about as ferocious as a flea! Like this one! Picks flea off of Twyla) There's another! And another",Ow! Ouch! Hey!,Line up.,"Things are going to be a bit different around here now, starting with your attire. Holds up one of the proper grey dresses, then fades to Genevieve looking at the proper grey dress on her. Rowena starts teaching the girls how to become proper in the upstairs foyer) Fans up. Everyone but Fallon has their fans up, while Fallon struggles to open her fan) Blair, look alive!",I'm Fallon.
"Whatever. Now flutter them like this. Flutters fan, along with everyone else but Courtney) Coy. Feminine. Courtney flutters her fan fast) Lacey, you're creating a tornado.",I'm Courtney.,And I'm getting impatient! Try again. Just above your noses. Courtney flutters her fan normally above her nose) Good. Well. That's a start.,"Oh, look. Charming. The princesses notice Rowena talking, then Janessa walks to her bed) Desmond, remove this mess.",I can't believe this! Where did all of my books go? It's not fair. My things were fine right where they were. These bedspreads are awful. I miss all of the colors!
It's 8 o' clock! Hurry! Genevieve closes her book she's reading),Gasp!),"Rushes to her bed) Go, go, go!","Rushes to Lacey, where she's trying to push herself up) Here you go, Lacey. Helps Lacey get on her bed, then rushes towards the middle of the room as Rowena opens the bedroom doors while the clock stops chiming)","Genevieve. Late again, hm? You know bedtime is now! 8 o' clock."
"Uh, sorry, your grace.","Yes, tardiness is terribly umprincesslike habit, don't you think? I'll see everyone tomorrow, bright and early! Happy dreams, girls. Walks out of the bedroom)",She's so mean.,"If Papa knew what Rowena was really like, he'd change his mind.","Oh, I don't know. He did ask her to be in charge."
"Talk to him, Genevieve. He'll listen to you.","Now, where did we leave off? Bishop to queen 3.","Hmm, you're making me pay for beating you last time?",Exactly!,You'll have to wait a little longer. Rook takes bishop.
Oh. How did I miss that?,"Um, Papa, I was wondering.","If I'll go easy on you, no. Knight to king 4.","It's about, uh, cousin Rowena.","Hm, charming, isn't she?"
"Very, uh, stylish. But, she's changing everything. She wants us to do everything in her own way.",As I've asked her to.,But we were fine before.,"Well, that's not what I've heard, Genevieve. Brings in a tray of tea) But, perhaps you're right. There'is so much work to be done. Maybe I am not the right one for the task. What you really need is an entire team, you see. Tutors for protocol, diction, language, etiquette, style. You'll see exhausting just to think about it. Oh, I should go. Yes, I should.","No. Rowena, you mustn't. My girls need you. I can't embarrass them in front of the kingdom by bringing groups of tutors. There's enough talk already."
"Well, if you really think I can be of service!","It's settled, then.","But, Papa.",You must listen to the Duchess. She knows what's best for you. I don't want to hear anymore on the subject.,"Yes, Papa. Runs out of the scene, and Twyla follows her)"
Oh. I hate to see her upset.,"Girls are so emotional. Prepares the tea for Randolph and herself. Randolph's cup of tea has poison in it, which makes him sick later in the film) What they need is proper guidance. Here, dear cousin. Try this tea. Smooth and refreshing. Randolph drinks the tea) To your health... Rowena drinks the tea)",He won't listen. He thinks Rowena is helping us.,This can't go on forever.,Can it?
At least tomorrow will be a good day.,Will we have cake? Claps),Presents?,A party?,"It's your birthday, isn't it? The triplets then laugh)"
"Shh! Begins to sing the birthday song, which makes the triplets wake up) Today it is your birthday and we sing to let you know, that you will be queen for the day, whatever you say goes. The triplets laugh) Happy birthday, girls. The triplets get out of their beds. Cuts to Ashlynn playing the flute and Fallon playing the harp.)","We spin for you, Janessa and chasse for you, Kathleen. We pirouette for Lacey, and we bow before the queens. Throws petals on the triplets, and the triplets laugh.)",We sing because we love you and we sing to let you know that you will be queen for the day-,You're late!,"Your grace, we were celebrating a special birthday."
"That's no excuse! Until you learn educate, the celebrations will wait.","But, we were just dancing. Mother made it a family tradition.","Hmm. And sadly, your mother is not here anymore, is she? And I am responsible for your upbringing. So dancing is forbidden strictly forbidden, and please, don't sing! It's out, too!",But it's our birthday.,A princess does not talk back. No dancing until you know how to act like royalty.
Where's Papa? He's never forgotten our birthday.,Walks by the triplets with her copy of The Dancing Princess in her hand along with Kathleen's copy) We still have a present for you.,"Walks by Lacey with Lacey's copy of The Dancing Princess in her hands) When we turned 5, Mother gave each of us a copy of her favorite story. Hands Lacey's copy of the book to her)",She had one made for each daughter. Shows her copy of the book),The Dancing Princess. Flips to first page)
"So the princess danced on each of the special stones. Then, on the 12th one, she twirled 3 times. And a secret door opened.",Where did it go?,"Flips to second page) She walked through a glowing light into a magic land. With trees of silver and gold! Flowers made of jewels. Flips to third page) Across the lake was a golden pavilion. The princess danced and danced to her heart's content. She wanted to stay forever, but that was not to be. The magic land vanished after the 3rd night. The princess was heartbroken, until she realized she brought some magic back with her. And it was hers to keep forever.",What kind of magic?,How did she do it?
"Hmm. It doesn't say. She notices Lacey grunting and drops her book, where it slid to her stone on the portal. Genevieve walks by Lacey, then notices Lacey's white lily on the book matches Lacey's white lily on the portal.) Kathleen, let me see your book. Genevieve grabs Kathleen's book, and places the book on Kathleen's stone, which has a daisy on it, just like the book.) Girls, quick. See if you can match the flower on your book to the flower on a stone.",I found a match.,Me too.,Me too.,Here's mine.
What does it mean?,"I have a feeling...Realizes the story) Oh, the story says the princess danced from stone to stone. Tries to dance stone to stone, but can't because she first stepped on Hadley's stone, then Isla's stone, which doesn't glow at all) Hmm, maybe a different order. Oldest to youngest! Where's yours, Ashlynn? Ashlynn points to her stone, which Genevieve dances on, which makes it glow and sings one part of the Barbie & The 12 Dancing Princesses theme song) Ah haha! Blair? Blair points to her stone, and Genevieve dances on it, which causes that stone to do the same effect) Oh, ha ha ha! Genevieve dances on the stones) Courtney, Delia, Edeline, Fallon, me, Hadley, Isla, Janessa, Kathleen, and Lacey. Tries to dance on Lacey's stone, but can't because it can't glow) Huh?",Why didn't mine work?,"I forgot something. The princess twirled 3 times. Proceeds to twirl 3 times, which makes 3 choir sounds and glows, then steps away from the portal so it can open)",Wow!
Holds railing) Who's coming with me? Starts to walk down the staircases.),Pinch me. I'm dreaming.,Then I'm having the same dream.,What do you think-,-That is?
Let's find out!,The trees are gold and silver!,It's just like in the story!,Amazing. Look at all the flowers!,Wow!
Look!,"Oh, it's so pretty!","It's just like Mother's Dance Pavilion! Oh, I wish we had some music! instruments appear) Did you see that? Come on, Lacey, dance with me!",Whoa!Lacey falls)Something like this always happens to me.,"I thought you were dancing beautifully. Come on, let's wash it off."
How did it?,I don't know.,I could use this all the time. She takes a scoop of fountain water),Wow! I actually wore out my shoes.,Me too.
"It's a sign, you know.",Of what?,That we've danced enough for one night. We better go home before Rowena finds out we're gone.,"Oh, I hate to leave. I could dance forever and ever and ever.",Did you like your birthday after all?
Yes.,"Thanks, Genevieve.","Good night, girls. Night, Twyla.","Good morning, ladies.",Good morning.
"We're fine, thank you.",Someone was up way past their bedtime.,A visitor for the duchess.,Yes?,A Mr Fabian is here.
"Oh! Oh. Oh, yes. Yes, I was expecting him. Starts walking out the room before briefly turning around) I want answers when I return!",She's in a hurry.,And the king requests his daughters visit him in his quarters.,Papa?,"Well, look who's here. The wild bunch."
Are you sick?,"No, just tired. I didn't feel... I didn't feel up to breakfast this morning.","Papa, you won't believe what happened last night.",Last night? Don't remind me. We were supposed to celebrate your birthday and I fell asleep. Inexcusable. Is it too late to give you your presents?,No!
"Oooh, pretty.","Thank you, Papa.",Am I forgiven?,"Yes, Papa.",Pretty.
Ouch.,Oh. The tiger has a boo-boo.,Who said you could come in here?,"Let me think. Who was it? Oh, yeah. Me! Got a problem with that? What's going on here?","Clear out, Brutus!"
Make me.,Those don't belong to you!,Or you!,What do you think you're doing?,"The princesses' dancing shoes? Worn through. The spoilt brats have been out dancing. Do you know what this means? Do you? Princes! They're out dancing with princes. Do you know what that means? No, you don't. You're still a monkey. Marriage is what it means. If princes fall for those pampered pretties, my plans are ruined."
What's that? What are they up to?,"Come in, Rowena.",Oh! So much commotion. I thought you were unwell.,"I am, but I love when they sing for me.","Look how pale you are, dear cousin. That's enough for now, girls. Out. Out, please. Please, out."
"But, Papa...",Some tea will help.,"Papa, maybe you should call the doctor.","Good idea, Genevieve.","Eyes cloudy, skin clammy."
I sound like a fish.,"Sense of humor intact. Well, Your Highness, if you continue to rest and take this elixir, I believe you will recover shortly.",That's good news.,"Allow me, Doctor. I'll take care of everything.",Twice daily should do the trick. Your Highness.
"Now, you rest, cousin.","Good afternoon, Gregory","Good afternoon, Derek. The princesses are waiting in their mother's garden.","I've brought new shoes, as you requested. Were the ones before not to your liking?",Not at all. We just wore them out.
"We've been out dancing. Genevieve mimics the dance she did to get her and her sisters to the magic land the night before) One, two, three, and four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, and ten, eleven, twelve! sigh) A magical time.","Can you fix them, Derek?",Is that gold dust?,It's... a secret.,Oh. Of course. I didn't mean to pry.
"I didn't think you were prying. It's just... Never mind. Derek, may I ask you a favor?","Of course, Your Highness.","This morning, I saw Duchess Rowena give something to a man, a Mr. Fabian. He was short with a beard and he wore a blue coat.","Well, I'm afraid I don't know him.",Would you find out who he is? Without letting the duchess know. I don't trust her.
Meeeeow!,"Hey, hey, hey! Watch the feathers.","Twyla, please.",Lock her up and throw away the key.,Felix!
"Sorry, Your Highness. What are you doing? Derek muttered to his pet bird)",Me? The cat started it.,Twyla!,"One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve. Excellent. I'll see you all in the morning. No excuses. Good night. I said good night.","Good night, m'lady."
"I want to know where they go, to whom they speak and when they sneeze.","Of course, Your Grace. My only reward is your happiness, my lady.","Correct, Desmond.",Is she gone? I thought I heard voices.,I don't hear anything now.
Let's go.,A whole night to forget Rowena and her rules. What shall we dance to first?,gasps) We love...,Ballet.,Good idea.
"Yay, ballet!",I wish we were dressed like ballerinas.,We wish we had ballet music.,"holds up a fan, mimicking Rowena) Who am I?",chuckles) The Duchess of Doom.
"You mean the Duchess of Don't. imitating Rowena) Don't do this. Don't do that. Don't, don't, don't!",laugh,He came a long way to visit Duchess Rowena. Mr Fabian?,"You have me at a disadvantage. You know my name, but I don't know yours.",I’ve been asked to inquire about your business with the duchess.
"That's between me and the duchess, isn't it?",I wouldn't want to get my master angry.,The bird talks?,"Last time somebody refused my master, the fool was never heard from again.",That's not true.
"Oh, you're right. They did find a shoe.","Please. I'm just a simple apothecary. I sell herbs, remedies. That's all.",What did you sell the duchess?,"I almost didn't sell her anything. Everybody knows she doesn't pay her bills. At this time, however, she came through. Small, but it's silver.",Where are we going?
We need to show Princess Genevieve the goblet.,That will be a long walk for you. I hope you made a pair of shoes for yourself.,Don't make me wish I kept the horse instead of you.,Never mind.Forget I'm even here.,Well?
"Nobody came in or out. I was here all night, Your Grace.","Wonderful. enters the bedroom) Good morning, girls. A beautiful day, isn't it? The princesses continue to sleep) Rise and shine. We have a busy day ahead of us.",Weren't these new yesterday? Line up this instant!,"Where were you dancing last night? Answer me, Delia!",I'm Edeline.
I don't care! Answer me!,"We, uh...we danced at a pavilion.",How did you get there? Blair?,I'm Kathleen,So what?!
The magic boat took us!,Please. How did you get out of here without Desmond seeing you?,pointing to the portal) The magic gateway!,"Magic this, magic that... You're all lying to me! to Lacey) You're the runt of this family. Tell me the truth or you'll all pay.",How can you talk to her that way?!
But... but it is the truth.,"How dare you talk back to me!? You're no better than common maids! Maybe if I treat you like maids, you'll change your minds about lying to me. This morning, you shall clean the front garden. I want it spotless!",But we were supposed to --,"Tsk, tsk, tsk, talking back... Now you'll scrub the steps as well!",We can't even sing to pass the time.
I don't understand why Papa...,Won't listen to us.,How did everything get so awful?,sighs) At least the garden's done. All that's left is the steps. Lacey accidentally drops a basket leaves making a mess),"Oh. I... I didn't mean to. I'm sorry! Lacey runs off, sobbing)"
Lacey! Genevieve runs after her youngest sister to a special part of the garden) Want some company?,Guess so.,I used to come here when I was upset.,"Why can't I be good at something? Edeline and Delia are good at sports, Courtney's read every book ever written, Blair rides her horses, and you're the most beautiful dancer.",I thought you were going to say I'm always late.
That too.,"You probably don't remember, but Mother always told us: Big or small, there's a difference only you can make. inside) It's been a long day. We'll feel better if we say good night to Papa.",I just don't understand why I'm still sick.,"Frankly, I'm not surprised, with the burdens you carry. 12 of them, if you know what I mean.","12 burdens? My daughters do worry me. I must admit, I lose sleep over them. Genevieve and Lacy quietly walk back to their room.) But they're hardly burdens. They're the best part of my life."
sighs) Could this day get any worse?,miserably) Ugh... I ache all over.,Did you see Papa?,Not exactly.,sternly) Tired? Sore? Frustrated? Now maybe I can hear the truth.
We told you the truth!,That ridiculous story? What else? Flowers with diamonds on them?,Not all the flowers.,"Now you're mocking me! Apparently, you didn't learn your lesson. Tomorrow you'll clean the stables. As for tonight, I'm locking you in. Nobody's going dancing, I promise you that.",angerly) Papa would never lock us in!
"Your father is sick. And who can blame him? Taking care of you with your wild ways. If you really want your father to get better, you'll leave him alone! Rowena slams and locks the doors and storms out of the room.)","I have failed you again, my grace. How may I redeem myself?","We'll see, won't we? If anybody - anybody - sneaks in or out, alert me at once.",I never realized Papa was so disappointed in us.,I heard him tell Rowena that we're burdens.
He did?,That's terrible.,Everything's so wrong here.,Twyla has the right idea. There's still one place we can go where we won't disappoint anybody.,We'll give Papa some time...
To get better.,Maybe it's best if we go.,"Nobody came or left, my lady.","Desmond, get in here! the bedroom is completely deserted) Do you see any princesses?","Well, uh..."
Neither do I!,But I never left the door.,"Ah, yes. A broken heart. Well, I should've realized. In that case, medicine can't help him.",That's what I was afraid of.,"Now, now. Don't give up hope, Your Grace. I'll check in tomorrow."
"Yes, please do.","Hello, sir. May I see Princess Genevieve?",whispering)Haven't you heard? The princesses are missing.,Missing?,This cannot be good.
I heard Duchess Rowena say they've run away. Desmond pushes the doorman out),"You, cobbler. We don't need you today.",But I need to see Princess Genevieve.,"I said, be gone!",Tell me you're going to leave.
Eventually.,"This is risky. Risky! You're crazy. If you're caught, you'll be thrown in the dungeon.","If you don't pipe down, we'll both be thrown in the dungeon.",Satisfied? She isn't here. Now let's go.,"My shoe polish. Over there, and there."
Newsflash. She walked in her own room.,"But not everywhere. She started here, where the polish is thickest.",You have got to be kidding.,What did you do?,"Two, three, four, five..."
"My, weren't we paying close attention?",to Blair) Wouldn't it be nice if we had a dancing partner? I wish I could dance with a handsome prince. the golden statues come to life and one of them takes Fallon’s hand) I'd love to.,I wish I could dance with a prince too.,I wish that too.,This is what you wanted to show me? I'm aware the princesses are gone. What on earth are you doing? Wasting my time.
gasps) So there was a method to your madness.,Princess Genevieve.,Derek? What are you doing here? How did you find us?,A lucky guess. You were right not to trust the duchess. She gave this to the stranger you saw.,Rowena's been stealing from Mother?
He gave up his horse for that.,You did? Or is that just the bird talking?,I don't know what to say.,"The spoilt brats were telling the truth! I wish I could see what's going on. a monoculer magically appear) Will wonders never cease? Get me some of those flowers. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve. All accounted for. How very convenient. Hurry. Opportunity knocks.",Why would Rowena steal Mother's goblet?
And give it to an apothecary?,We have to go home and tell Papa.,"If we leave now, we can never come back.",Why not?,"In Mother's story, the princess only visited the land three times before it vanished forever."
I can't imagine never coming back not ever!,"Rowena may not think we're proper princesses, but we are princesses. We can't turn our backs when things get difficult. Papa needs us.",gasps) What's happening?,It's all disappearing!,And the last one.
How will we get back?,What are we going to do?,"sickly) My daughters, are they coming soon?","Haven't they visited you yet? Oh, I hate to say it, but your daughters are not the most responsible girls.","I appreciate all that you're doing for them. I only wish I could do more. Well, perhaps you can. Would you ever consider standing in for me? Just until I recover."
"writing a proclamation) I, King Randolph, hereby proclaim Duchess Rowena to be queen until I can resume my royal duties. The royal seal.",Your Highness.,"You can count on me, dear cousin.",What do you think happened?,I can't believe a place our mother loved could trap us. I wish to know the way out.
We danced our way in...,...So we can dance our way out!,"trying to redo it) One, two... Hm. It's not working.","Let me try. One, two... That's odd.",What do we do now?
It seems so right.,Oh!,You have to dance together! Oh! How romantic!,What are you waiting for? An invitation?,May I have this dance?
Of course.,"Until the king recovers, I am queen. I've hired you to protect me.",And the princesses?,"Traitors, you mean. They've run away in the king's time of need. If you see them, which I doubt, throw them in the dungeon.","As you wish, Your Highness."
Follow me.,Mother's dance pavilion?,I'm not surprised it leads here.,I'll miss going there.,We all will.
Let's find Papa.,Queen Rowena has given us orders.,Queen?,Capture the princesses and throw them in the dungeon.,And the king?
He's sick and won't last the night.,How did this happen?,Did they just say Papa was ill?,We have to save him.,What about Desmond?
And all the new guards?,And if Rowena is queen...,We still have something Rowena doesn't. The power of 12.,What are we? Invisible?,Whoa!
I'll bring the doctor as fast as I can. she rides on the horse to get the doctor),from the floor) Hey! Hey! Come back here!,"That's it, cousin. The very last drop.",Dizzy. My head. groans),"You won't be missed, Randolph. At least, not by me. Ha ha ha!"
"Rowena, what have you... done?","Yes, you've ruled long enough, haven't you?",Papa! What did you do to him?,What? How? How did you? Desmond? Desmond!,sarcastically) I'm sorry. He won't be coming.
What?,"He's locked up, Rowena. Just like you're going to be.","Oh, you think so? I wish for armor to protect the queen!","Right. banging, he escapes)",I better warn them about Desmond. he flies away but gets pinned down by Brutus) What do you think you are doing?
Ow!,Oh. Did that hurt? What about this one?,"No, not a purple one. They're my favorite.",Owww! Aaargh!,"Thanks, tiger."
Come on. Get them. Get them!,"Nice timing. Derek! she throws the chair arm to Derek and knocks the mace out of the armor’s hands, with one swipe of the leg, one is down. Then the other goes down) It's over, Rowena.",Genevieve!,Lacey?,"Over? Oh, really? Not if you want to see your sister again. Always the ringleader. Looks at Genevieve's slippers) Why not give you what you've always wanted? I wish you would dance forever and ever and ever!"
